## What is a Reiki session?

A Reiki session lasts for 45 minutes. The receiver wears comfortable clothing and lays on a massage table throughout the healing. I will place my hands (or hover) in a special placement order, covering both the front and back of the body. The energy flows effortlessly where it is needed in order to produce the highest good to it's recipient.

## What can be treated with Reiki?

Reiki is a universal life energy force, and is used for the highest good in both the practitioner and the receiver. It may be used for physical ailments such as discomfort, post-surgery issues, skin conditions, and any other healing that the body may need. Mentally, reiki can bring peace and clarity with a deeper understanding of issues and emotions. Spiritually, reiki enhances what each individual has inside and refreshes his or her connection with the Universal Consciousness.

## What will I feel during the session?

During the treatment, the receiver will feel a great calmness, relaxation, and often times, fall asleep. Some experience warm sensations where my hands are laid, and other see subtle colors through closed eyes.

## What can I expect after the session? 

After the session, most often the receiver continues throughout his or her day with a feeling of calmness and peace. In certain circumstances, emotions may arise or a physical ailment may seem to worsen, but this is merely a sign that the reiki is working while detoxing the body and mind.
